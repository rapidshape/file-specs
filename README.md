# Filetypes

This repository contains specifications, descriptions, integration instructions and examples for all file types that are potentially used in Rapid Shape 3D ecosystems.

## 3MF + Slice Extension

The 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) is used to bring 3D and slicing information from a CAE/CAM Software (Slicing software) to Rapid Shape Printers. Currently, the portfolio of supported printers is limited but in the medium and long term, numerous other Rapid Shape printers will be equipped with the 3mf process.

## RShapeSTL

This format was defined by Rapid Shape and is used to transport STL data of a set of related parts/models from a CAD/CAM application or a manufacturing control system (e.g. RSPC) to a CAE/CAM Software (Slicing software). This format contains both general and model-specific metadata that can be further processed by a slicing software and/or forwarded to Rapid Shape printers.
